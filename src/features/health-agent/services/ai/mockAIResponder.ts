/**
 * Mock AI responder (Step 13 §26).
 *
 * Produces a schema-valid AIChatResponse WITHOUT any real AI backend so the
 * full structured pipeline (validation → safety layer → orchestrator merge)
 * is exercised end-to-end in demo mode. Every payload is truth-tagged
 * `mode: 'mock'` and the UI labels it "CareLink demo response".
 *
 * It reuses the deterministic heuristic classifier so intent behaviour stays
 * identical between the classic path and the structured path.
